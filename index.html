      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p>I am an aspiring Web Developer. I am 29 years old, and while that may seem young, mentally, I feel like I'm 100 years old. My friends call me an "old soul". I also love dogs!</p>
      <h1>Where I'm From</h1>
      <p>I am from Richton Park, Il. A small suburb south of Chicago. </p>
      <h1>What are your favorite hobbies?</h1>
      <p>My favorite hobbies include: working out, reading, running, listening to music, traveling, exploring nature, and spending time with my loved ones.</p>
      <h1>What's your dream job?</h1>
      <p>My dream job is to work in the music industry and interview different artists/musicians. I would love to interview my favorite artists and ask them questions about their work. I feel like most interviewers don't ask the right questions that a true fan would want the answer to.</p>
      <h1>Where do you live?</h1>
      <p>I live in Park Forest, Il.</p>
      <h1>Why do you want to be a web developer?</h1>
      <p>I want to be a web developer because I want to change my career. I think it will be fun, rewarding, and challenging. It will also give me a chance to flex my creative side and see things/ideas come to life. This is a skill that I can take with me anywhere in this world. It would give me the opportunity to live anywhere and still be able to work a job that I would love.</p>
